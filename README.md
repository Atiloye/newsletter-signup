## Overview

### Work-done
After coding:
I was able to:
-Add an email and submit the form
- See a success message with the email after successfully submitting the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Challenges
I didn't understand the JS for valid form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
